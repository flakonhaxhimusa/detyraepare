    <h1>History of Facebook</h1>


    <p>
        <em> Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta
            Platforms.</em>
        Founded in 2004 by <b> Mark Zuckerberg</b> with fellow Harvard College students and roommates <b>Eduardo Saverin,
            Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes</b>, its name comes from the face book directories often
        given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually
        expanding to other North American universities and, since <strong>2006</strong>, anyone over 13 years old. As of July 2022,
        Facebook claimed <strong>2.93</strong> billion monthly active users, and ranked third worldwide among the most visited
        websites as of <strong>July 2022</strong>. It was the most downloaded mobile app of the <strong>2010</strong>s.

         - and I thought that real identity should play a bigger part than it did
